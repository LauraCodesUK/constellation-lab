# Reflection Log – 2025-10-27

## 🧠 Skill Learned / Practiced
Setting up my first GitHub repository and learning how version control works in practice.  
Explored how repositories, commits, branches, and README files interact, and how GitHub Desktop simplifies those actions.

## 🏆 Achievement
Created my first public repo (`weather-cube`) with a structured README, proper `.gitignore`, and MIT license.  
Successfully committed and pushed files to GitHub, including the initial folder setup for host/device code.  
Learned how to create visible empty folders using `.gitkeep`.

## 💡 Interesting Facts / Tangents
- Discovered **ORCID IDs** as a way to link published or academic work to my developer identity.  
- Learned about **virtual environments (venv)** — how they isolate dependencies so different projects don’t interfere with each other.  
- Understood that `.gitignore` protects large or sensitive files (like `.env` and `.venv`) from being committed accidentally.

## ⚙️ Challenges
At first, the Git/GitHub terminology (commit, push, pull, branch) felt abstract, and the idea of writing and structuring a **README** was unexpectedly overwhelming.  
The information seemed jumbled — I wasn’t sure what belonged where or what tone to use.  
After considering how *I* would like to read a project overview, and thinking of it like a **scientific experiment write-up** (objectives, method, results, reflection), the structure became clearer and more intuitive.  
That shift in mindset helped me move from confusion to clarity, and to produce a README I’m genuinely happy with.

## 🧩 Mitigation / Solution
Used GitHub Desktop’s visual interface to understand commit flow before touching Git Bash or VS Code terminals.  
Reinforced learning by documenting each step carefully and treating the README like a research record — focusing on clarity, reproducibility, and logical flow.

## 🪴 Notes
This was the first major step in making my learning visible.  
I now understand how GitHub can act as both a **learning journal** and a **professional development tool**, not just a code host.
